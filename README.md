# PomodoroTimer
PomodoroTimer is a timer that allows you to choose a certain work time and break time - these will run indefinetly until you turn them off.  
This way you can remember to take breaks regularly.  
The preset work and break times are 25 and 5 minutes (the Pomodoro technique) but can be changed to your tastes.

## Installation
Import this project to Android Studio to run it on your phone.

## Options
You can choose your own work time and break time (from 1 second up to 60 minutes and 59 seconds).  
Once the time runs out for the work time or the break time an alarm and vibration notifies you.    
Both the alarm and vibration can be turned on and off and the alarm volume can be adjusted.   
You can choose your own alarm by uploading any audio file (this feature is still work in progress and currently resets when the app is closed.)
