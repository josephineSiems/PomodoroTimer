# PomodoroTimer
Pomodoro Timer is a timer that allows you to choose a certain work time and break time, these will run indefinetly until you turn them off. 
This way you can remember to take breaks regularly. 
The preset work and break times are 25 and 5 minutes (the Pomodoro technique) but can be changed to your tastes.
